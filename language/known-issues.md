# Known Issues

- eager evaluation doesn't halt when encounters Y fixed pointer combinator usage (by theory Y does not work with eager evaluation)
- symbolic evaluation doesn't halt when encounters unused Y fixed pointer combinator (try to fix?)
- symbolic evaluation doesn't halt when encounters unused Z fixed pointer combinator (try to fix?)
